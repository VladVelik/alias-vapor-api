Welcome to our project with the implementation of the game alias!

To start the game you should:
1. Run a local server located in the **Server** folder
2. Set up the necessary software for correct client-server interaction
2a. Check that you have a Vapor installed
2b. Start docker with *docker compose up db* command
3. Run the game (**App** folder). To make sure it works, you can run several simulators in xcode.
4. You are amazing! Now you can register and play!

You can see server requests <a href="https://github.com/VladVelik/alias-vapor-api/blob/main/Server/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
